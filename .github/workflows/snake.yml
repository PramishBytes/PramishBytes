### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Edit README.md

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Create assets folder (optional, if you want local banner)

If you want a local custom image later, we can do that. But for now, the above uses a pre-made hacker GIF online (so you don‚Äôt need to upload anything).

## üí• Your pinned repos

You can rename and add 3‚Äì5 new pinned repos to look more "hackerish", for example:

### Suggested pinned repos

| Repo Name         | Description                            |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `Payloads`        | Curated payload collections for exploit testing. |
| `Exploits`        | Custom exploits and PoCs for vulnerability research. |
| `OSINT-Toolkit`   | Open-source intelligence automation tools. |
| `Recon-Scripts`   | Reconnaissance and fingerprinting scripts. |
| `Red-Team-Labs`   | Simulated attack environment experiments. |

---

## ‚ö° If you'd like, I can also prepare **all the README.md files for each pinned repo**, so you just paste them there too.

---

### ‚úÖ What you should do next

1Ô∏è‚É£ Copy & paste the final README above right now.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Let me know if you'd like me to **prepare README files for each pinned repo** too.  

---

üí£ Once you do this, your profile will look fully hacker-themed and **ready to show off**.  

‚öîÔ∏è Tell me **"Yes, also prepare pinned repo READMEs"** if you'd like that ‚Äî and I'll send you all in one go!
